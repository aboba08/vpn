        <p class="fqacontent2">Privacy policy</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent">In this policy, we describe how we are processing your personal data as a data controller.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent2">Policy overview</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent">Our underlying policy is that we want you to remain anonymous when using our service. It is therefore our policy to never store any activity logs or metadata and to have as minimal data retention as possible. However, in some situations we might process your personal data if you, for example, are making payments by a bank wire, PayPal, Swish, Stripe, etc. or are sending an e-mail or reporting a problem. In those cases, we might process your personal data. Also, if you use our service for illegal purposes, we have every right to revoke your license key and restrict access to our service.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent2">General payment data</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent">Certain payment data must be kept for the statutory retention period described in applicable local laws. If not required by law or stated above, the data will be stored for no longer than necessary for the purpose. After the statutory retention periods, the data will be permanently deleted.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent2">Payments</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent">Payment information are processed for the purpose of providing you with the service we offer, to pay out refunds and for accounting purposes. The processing of payment data for the first two purposes are based on a legitimate interest where our rights to process the data for such interest overrides your rights to your personal data.

        <p class="fqacontent">Processing of e-mails and problem reports via our social media and email are made for the purpose of answering questions, resolve problems, and provide general support to customers. The processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interests where such interest overrides your rights to your personal data.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="fqacontent">After "solving" or "closing" a support case/problem report, all related emails/problem reports are archived (removed from the inbox). After six months, all emails/problem reports sent to our support address are automatically, permanently erased (from inbox, deleted items, sent items, trash, and archives).</p>
